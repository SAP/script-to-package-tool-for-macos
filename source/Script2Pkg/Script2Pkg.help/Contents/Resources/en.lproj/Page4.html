The Apple notary service is an automated system that scans an installer package for malicious content and checks for code-signing issues, so notarization of a signed installer package ensures that Apple has passed the signed code through an automated scanning process and verified that the signed code is free of malicious content. macOS's security tools can check the notarization status of a signed and notarized installer package.</span>
