            <span class="Normal">Notarization is an additional safeguard against signed installer packages being modified by a malicious third party. The Apple notary service is an automated system that scans an installer package for malicious content and checks for code-signing issues, so notarization of a signed installer package ensures that Apple has passed the signed code through an automated scanning process and verified that the signed code is free of malicious content. macOS's security tools can check the notarization status of a signed and notarized installer package.</span>

            <span class="Normal">Installer package receipt files are used by macOS to maintain a record of what the Installer application has installed. Normally, a receipt file is created each time you install new software via a package file but there is an exception to this rule: payload-free packages normally do not install any files and do not leave a receipt behind. The receipt files will contain the following information:</span>
